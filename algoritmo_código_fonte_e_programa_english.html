            <h1>Algorithm, source code and program</h1> <br>
            <p>what's the difference?</p>

        <div class="primeiro_paragrafo">

            <span class="centralizar">Let's explore these terms...</span><br><br>
            In the world of technology, it is common, especially at the beginning, to use nomenclatures such as
            algorithms, programs and
            source codes... "This is a computer program!" "Take a look at this code!"<br>
            All these nomenclatures come from the study of programming logic, the first subject to be dealt with when
            Talk about technology. This area is the basis for learning to program, as it is about how you,
            programmer, will communicate with the computer in a way that it understands. And oddly enough he doesn't
            understands slang, abbreviations or everyday conversations... Strange, right? Your communication is logical,
            it is the logic of
            schedule.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="centralizar">What's an algorithm?</span><br><br>
            We use programming logic to raise
            algorithms, codes (source-codes) and programs. Let's specify each um from these conceits…<br>
            Well, it's all pretty much the same thing... a computer program is a set of commands that will
            performed hair computer. This set of commands must follow a logical ratio, or that in mathematics is
            called of algorithm. This algorithm is something higher level (this is, easy to understand, far from
            machine language is close to human language) something your voice can explain to your grandparents or
            for their newest irmão, that they will understand. Now, for your computer to understand, it is precise that
            o
            algorithm would be written in source-code form. And finally, a program is the source code in the context of
            execution, or be, when it is running, being executed by a computer (it is an application,
            site…). You can also receive the name of Software. Or be it, no bottom, no bottom, everything is the same
            thing!<br>
            Algorithms are summarized as being an ordered set of logical steps. Algorithms with Simply
            a set of steps or instructions that you follow to do something or solve a problem. Let's compare
            with something good family: Make a ball<br>
            I guess that voice is going to make a ball. For this there are a series of steps/processes to get fazer um
            ball:<br>
            1. Reserve ingredients and utensils <br>
            2. Clear shoes in snow and reserve <br>
            3. Mix the gems, margarine and sugar until you get a homogeneous mass <br>
            4. Increase the milk and wheat flour a little, continuing to beat. <br>
            5. Add the egg whites and yeast <br>
            6. Bulk clearance in a greased form <br>
            7. Axle the cake in the oven <br>
            8. Wait 40 minutes<br>
            9. Retire the ball <br>

        <div class="segundo_paragrafo">
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="centralizar">What's an source code? </span><br><br>
            The source code is to contextualize these step-by-step steps in a programming language (in a language,
            say.). It is as if the algorithms were the grammar of the program and the source code of the language (the
            languages
            parts of similar syntactic, morphological, non-minimal structures... This is, all of them have verbs and
            conjugations mostly use other words to express themselves). <br>
            So, the source code is the list of things
            that either the programmer writes for or the fazer computer. For example,
            you can say to the computer: "Show an image", "Play music" or "Open a page on the Internet"
            These instructions are written in a special language that the computer can understand, as if it were a
            secret language among the people who make programs and computers.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="centralizar">What's an computer program?</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, think of a program as if it were the final step you make following the recipe.
            The program is the result of everything the computer does following the instructions of the source code. So,
            when the programmer writes the source code, he is creating a program, which is the final product. For
            for example, a video game is a program, and a website where you see pictures of animals is also
            um program. So in summary, step-by-step algorithms in a way that the voice understands (in Portuguese),
            codes with these step by step so that the computer understands and programs with these codes being
            executed, or final product.
