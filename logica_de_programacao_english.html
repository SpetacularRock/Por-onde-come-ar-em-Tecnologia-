            <span class="centralizar">What is Programming Logic?</span><br>
            <br><br>
            Programming logic is the way in which actions performed by algorithms are conducted. All programming
            presents a logical chain so that the codes described can execute the assigned commands. In this
            sense, the programmer is responsible for understanding this logic and translating it
            efficiently for the machine.
            Programming logic is like a map that helps us get to a place, but instead of being a
            street map, it is a map of steps to solve problems. Imagine that you need to teach a robot to do something,
            like tidying its room. In order for the robot to do this correctly, you need to tell it, step by step, what
            it should do: pick up the toy, put it on the shelf, make the bed... and so on. Programming logic is exactly that: creating these steps for the computer, so that it knows what to do, and when to do it!<br>
            For example, if you want a program to organize a list of numbers, the first thing to do is think about what the first step will be. Should we compare the numbers? Or should we order the list in some specific way? Programming logic helps us to divide this task into smaller, well-defined steps, as if we were putting together a step-by-step process. These steps may involve decisions, repetitions, or even the use of other information to guide the program to the correct solution.

            In practice, programming logic involves three main concepts: sequence, condition, and repetition. Sequence
            is the order in which instructions are executed. Conditions are decisions that the program must make based
            on information it has (for example, "if the number is greater than 10, do one thing; if not, do another").
            Finally, repetition allows the program to perform the same task several times, which is useful when we need
            to perform the same operation on different data or even in an infinite loop, depending on the situation.
            These three concepts form the basis of many of the algorithms we use in programming. <br> Programming logic,
            then, is the heart of the entire software development process. Even if you are not a programmer,
            understanding how logic works is important, as it helps you think in an organized way and solve problems
            efficiently, whether you are programming a computer or organizing your own day-to-day work. When we master
            logic, we can build faster, easier-to-understand and maintain solutions, which is essential for both small
            projects and large software systems.

                In a nutshell...</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This area is the basis for learning to program, because it is about how you, the programmer, will
            communicate with the computer in a way that it understands. And, believe it or not, it does not understand
            slang, abbreviations or everyday conversations... Strange, isn't it? Your communication is logical, it is
            programming logic. Programming logic is one of the most required skills in the life of a developer.
