            Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm. What does that mean? Well, it means it's a
            method/mode/way of programming. And in this way there are new rules and terms to learn. Guided programming
            to objects(also known as "POO") aims to facilitate and bring the program closer to real life,
            leaving the code with more clarity and organization.

            It is easier to update software when it is structured in OOP.

            It is not static, easy to grow.

            You can easily reuse parts of an OOP code to create others.

            It is close to reality, high-level, programmer-friendly, easy to understand, natural.

            <br>
            <br>
            Object-oriented programming has two main structures: objects and classes.
            Classes are molds and objects are the products. Let's go... Before building something, it is necessary to have a
            plan, right? Maybe a design, sheets, documents. But in general, a plan is made for the object you want to create. Look around you and pick any object. This object you are looking at had to go through a planning process so that it could finally be built in dozens or hundreds of identical copies. The idea remains in these two elements.
            <span class="topico">Classes</span><br>
            Classes are these plans. They contain the characteristic information (attributes) and actions (methods) that their objects will have. It's like a cake mold. And the cake would be...
            <span class="topico">Objects</span><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Objects are instances of a class, that is, they are the final result. If the class is the mold, objects are the cakes. With the same mold, you can make cakes of various flavors and toppings, right? However, all of them will have the same shape because they were all baked in the same mold. This is how the relationship between objects and classes works.

        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="centralizar">Attributes and methods</span><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Attributes are the characteristics of these objects. And the methods are the actions related to them (what they can do). Again, look around and pick an object. No, not that one. Choose another. There! This one. Perfect, now notice that it has characteristics such as color, weight, size, height, width, brand, model, load... Ah, one important thing to mention is that characteristics are different from values, okay? Two different pens have the same characteristics because both have the characteristic "color." However, the values/domains of their respective characteristics are different. Keep that in mind. Perfect... now this very object you're looking at also has actions (methods). A remote control, for example, can turn on, turn off, blink, increase the volume, decrease the volume... A pen can write, scribble, draw, paint... ("Ah, but aren't they the same thing?" The answer is, it depends. It depends on your goal.) Therefore, an object will be perceptible by the senses, since it has attributes and methods, characteristics and actions.

        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="centralizar">What is considered an object?</span><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Well... you might be thinking: "Of course, right? I know what an object is. It's easy to notice." Well, I don't doubt that you know what an object is. However, in the context of object-oriented programming, they are a bit more comprehensive.<br>
        Commitment - Is a commitment an object? To answer this question, it is necessary to check if this element has attributes and/or methods. What are the characteristics of a commitment? The time, the day, the location, and the type (formal/informal), for example. And its methods? What can be done with it? It can be canceled, postponed, advanced, or rescheduled. Therefore, objects are more comprehensive and go beyond physical and material figures.

        Let's create a car class in an algorithm following the object-oriented programming paradigm:
        <br>
        <span class="codigo">

            class Car { <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            character color = "Black";<br>
            character brand = "Fiat";<br>
            logical on = true;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            method start{ <br>
            on = true; <br>
            write ("The car is on"); <br>
            } <br>
            method accelerate() { <br>
            if (on = true){<br>
            write ("Accelerating");<br>
            }
            else write() ("Turn on the car first!");<br>
            } <br>
            method brake() { <br>
            if (on = true){<br>
            write ("Braking");<br>
            } <br>
            else write ("Turn on the car first!");<br>
            } <br>
            } <br>
            } <br>
        </span>

        </div>

       <div class = "parallax5">

        </div>
        
       <div class = "segundo_paragrafo">
        Got it? Did it get a little more complicated? Let's go, first we created the class (mold). Then we defined its attributes (characteristics) which in this case were: color, model, speed, and on. Next, we defined some of its methods. The actions the car can take. For each attribute, we defined a value. We put text in the character-type variables and a logical value in the logical one (on). The logical variable in this example "on" represents whether the car is on or not (true or false). It’s a characteristic of whether it’s on or off. And this characteristic is logical. It can be either on or not. Then we defined the methods. For didactic purposes, I'll divide the methods we made into two types: "what changes an attribute" and "what does something." The first method we created altered the "on" attribute. In other words, it turned the car on. Therefore, we have a logical attribute that can be either on or not and a method/action that forces it to be on. Got the idea? Both have the same name, but they represent different aspects (an important detail is that one of the tips to visually distinguish methods from attributes is that methods use "()" at the end.). And the other type of method performed an action. At this point, you might ask: "Wow, why do the methods have so many things and the attributes don’t???" The answer is because an attribute is always an attribute. A characteristic is always going to be a characteristic regardless of the circumstances. Now a method is much more varied. Several factors are needed for an action to be performed (you can think of the "write" method, for example, where the pen needs to be charged, uncovered, and working...). Therefore, methods are always more filled because they need more specific circumstances to happen. And in the end, we put a write command in each method to see what’s happening with the car. In this way, we created a car class in OOP.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="centralizar">Creating an object</span>
        To create the car object in the algorithm, we simply do the following:<br>
        <span class="codigo">
            car1 = New Car; <br>
        </span>
        We will always follow the "formula": object name = new Class Name. It’s like we are calling a
        new object for that class, that’s why the word "new" (actually, that’s exactly what it is).
        And if you want to change an attribute of this object or call a method:
        <span class="codigo"><br>
            car1.color = "Blue";<br>
            car1.accelerate();<br>
        </span>
        This object called car1 is now blue and accelerating. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="codigo"><br>
            car2.color = "Gray";<br>
            car2.braking();<br>
            Now, this other object called car2 is gray and braking.
        </span>
    </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class = "primeiro_paragrafo">
        <span class="centralizar">To summarize...</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes the code into "objects", which are
        instances of "classes". Each object is an entity that has characteristics (attributes) and behaviors
        (methods), and each class is the blueprint of these objects, where all share the same base and can differ later.
